# Alternate ear graphics
A small mod I threw together which replaces certian mutation graphics with ones i'd redesigned. 
FULL DISCLAIMER, I designed these alternate graphics for a particular character of mine! I only made this because a few people seemed interested. Use this with the understanding that these graphics arent intended to work with all hairstyles, hair colours, skin colours or whatever other variables that might be relevant. 
Results may vary, you have been warned.

# Dependencies
Requires [DeadPeopleTileset](https://github.com/SomeDeadGuy/Cata-MSX-DeadPeopleTileset). 
The go to tileset for CDDA by this point and for good reason, its great!

# Usage Guide
This mod can be enabled mid-game, all it does is replace a few textures and add a few extra recipes. The ears arent covered properly by hats so make some of the cosmetic ears to layer ontop if your character has headwear. Ideally i'd make these specific mutations render over clothes but apparently that would take a load of C++ sorcery and i aint no harry potter.

### Issues
At the time of this writing, all the features in this mod are tested and work as intended. Lets hope that lasts!
